# Distributed Architecture - Management System

This project implements a distributed architecture with multiple independent services that interact with each other. The application includes a user service, a product service, and an API Gateway that acts as an entry point for clients.

---

## Services

### 1. User Service
- **Port**: `3001`
- **Description**: Manages the system's users.
- **Endpoints**:
- `GET /`: Gets all users.
- `POST /`: Creates a new user.

### 2. Product Service
- **Port**: `3003`
- **Description**: Manages the products available in the system.
- **Endpoints**:
- `GET /`: Gets all products.
- `POST /`: Creates a new product.

### 3. API Gateway
- **Port**: `3000`
- **Description**: Acts as an entry point for clients and routes requests to the appropriate services.
- **Endpoints**:
- `GET /users`: Gets all users (via the User Service).
- `POST /users`: Creates a new user (via the User Service).
- `GET /products`: Gets all products (via the Product Service).
- `POST /products`: Creates a new product (via the Product Service).

### 4. MongoDB
- **Port**: `27017`
- **Description**: Database used to store user and product data.

## Requirements

- **Docker**: Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- **Postman** (optional): To test the endpoints.
